INTRODUCTION

In Breast Cancer Classification with Keras we are using mod-ern day method, technologies, processes and new ways of thinking of solving a problem in an accurate and effective manner by using techniques which are inspired by the work-ing of human brain and biological neural network and serves to improve Artificial Intelligence and which is applied in many fields of computer vision, speech recognition, natural lan-guage processing, drug design and audio recognition which is Deep Learning.

Along with ML (Machine Learning) we are using Keras which is an open source neural network library written in python. Keras is a high level API which can run on the top of Theano (optimising compiler which are excessed using NumPy-esque syn-tax),CNTK (Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit) and TenserFlow (open source software library). It is all about enabling fast prototyp-ing and experimentation while seamlessly running on Graph-ical Process Unit and Computer Processing Unit. Along with that it is an extensible, modular and user friendly.
